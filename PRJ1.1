== Proposal

=== Objectives
By using a regression model to predict the fatality, injury, and index of those events based on time, etc.

=== Preprocessing
We might use a filter to eliminate fewer effective variables, including postcode.

=== Output
Fatality, injury. We are supposed to generate an index dependent on fatality and injury.  
(like grade for these events, 10 for heavy, 1 for less heavy).

=== Input
Date, Record type, latitude, longitude, type of incident, and BIN (business effect case combined with another data).

=== Mathematical formulation
Injury/Fatality index = β₀ + β₁ (type of events) + β₂ (time) + β₃ (some other variable)

If using an injury number, then use Poisson or negative Binomial regression.  

As you can see, its meaning is to help avoid incidents or accidents and add more protection during that period.  
The model seems good to find which attributes dominate the incident based on a linear or other regression model.
